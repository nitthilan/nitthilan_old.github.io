###### About
Inspired from Pixar, Dreamworks, Sony and other animation studios. The general time required to produce an animated feature from conception to final rendered version has a long production time. 
Can Artificial Intelligence based solutions help in reducing this time line? 

The current advancements in deep learning in the area of GAN, Neural Rendering
